# Zk-e2e-chat

This project presents a novel application of ZK proofs for decentralized end-to-end encrypted messaging. The use of ZK credentials for message verification is an innovative approach that enhances privacy and security compared to traditional centralized encrypted messaging platforms.

The project addresses the important problem of secure and private communication, which is increasingly crucial in today's digital landscape. By leveraging decentralized identities and ZK-based proof mechanisms, the ZK-Chat system can provide users with a more trustworthy and privacy-preserving alternative to existing messaging platforms.

The integration with Aligned's Fast Mode for efficient ZK proof verification also makes the system more scalable and cost-effective, which could help drive user adoption. Additionally, the seamless user experience design aims to hide the technical complexities from end-users, further increasing the project's potential to attract a wider audience.

## Project Objectives

The primary goals of the ZK-E2E-Chat project are:

1. **End-to-End Encrypted Messaging**: Implement a messaging application that leverages ZK proofs to verify message authenticity without revealing the message contents.
2. **Efficient Proof Verification**: Utilize Aligned's Fast Mode to enable low-cost and low-latency verification of ZK proofs related to message authentication.
3. **Seamless User Experience**: Create a user-friendly interface that hides the complexity of the underlying ZK-based mechanisms from end-users.

## Technical Approach


### 1. End-to-End Encrypted Messaging

- Implement a messaging application that uses end-to-end encryption to protect message contents.
- Use ZK proofs to verify the authenticity of messages without revealing the plaintext.
- Integrate with the smart contract to link user identities to their encrypted messages.

### 2. Efficient Proof Verification

- Utilize Aligned's Fast Mode APIs to verify ZK proofs of user message authenticity.
- Optimize the ZK circuit designs to minimize the computational complexity and cost of proof generation and verification.
- Explore techniques like batched proof verification to further improve efficiency.

### 3. Seamless User Experience

- Develop a user-friendly web or mobile application interface for the ZK-Chat system.
- Abstract away the technical details of ZK proofs from end-users.
- Provide intuitive flows for user registration, message composition, and conversation management.

## Key Technical Components

- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js, or similar framework for the user-facing application.
- **Backend**: Rust for core business logic, including ZK proof generation and verification.
- **Message Encryption**: Use standard end-to-end encryption protocols (e.g., Signal Protocol).
- **Aligned Integration**: Leverage Aligned's Fast Mode APIs for efficient ZK proof verification.
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based smart contracts for on-chain identity and message storage.
- **Data Availability**: Explore the use of EigenDA for efficient data availability.
